# 📧 Respuesta a Meta: Ya No Uso 360Dialog

Thank you for your response, Jay.

I understand that Meta sees my phone number +54 9 11 3762-3550 as associated with 360Dialog as a Business Solution Provider.

However, I want to clarify:
- I have CANCELLED my 360Dialog service
- I am NO LONGER using 360Dialog
- I want to use WhatsApp Cloud API DIRECTLY through Meta (not through any BSP)

The issue is:
- My phone number is stuck in "PENDING" status since December 20, 2025
- The display name "Estudio Pos y Asociados" is pending approval
- I cannot use the number because Meta still sees it as managed by 360Dialog

I need Meta to:
1. Remove the BSP association from my phone number
2. Allow me to manage it directly through Meta Cloud API
3. Process the Display Name approval for "Estudio Pos y Asociados"

I have already contacted 360Dialog to release the number, but I need Meta's assistance to complete the transition to direct Cloud API management.

Please help me resolve this so I can use my WhatsApp Business number.

Thank you.
